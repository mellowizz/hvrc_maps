This is a collection of maps of the Mid Hudson Region.

These maps are made with freely available data and contain no warranty as to
their accuracy. 

All folders contain data from the respective county's GIS freely available data.
Data has been converted to different file formats to reduce bandwidth and take
advantage of more features over Esri's Shapefile format.
